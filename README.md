# Whitepink Dots

## Info
These are some lightmode dotfiles I used on LFS.

## Installation
I trust you're smart enough to figure it out yourself. I may provide instructions in the future for convenience but I can't be asked rn.

## Credits
I stole and tweaked a bunch of catppuccin config files. The color scheme is inspired by an N++ flavor.
